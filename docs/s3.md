# SLV S3 bucket

**NOTE: This document is only relevant to puppet employees**

The SLV team has an s3 bucket for storing results from performance testing

`
s3://slv-performance-results
`

## Convention

S3 doesn't have true directories.  But it does like to make it look like it does.  The convention 
is to use names like `foo/bar`  and `foo/car` to group files together.  They are really two separate
file that exist next to each other, but with the cli you can `ls foo/` and you will get both.

For our use, we will put results relating to a specific release in `<release_name>/<ticket>` Using
the internal name like Kearney.

If it isn't specific to a release, put it in `tickets/<ticket>`
 
## How to access/use it

The bucket is owned by the Developer user for our ESO account which we should all have access
to.  Use that from the aws console to manipulate anything about how the bucket is setup. 

### Install the aws cli

Follow the 
[Installing AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) 
instructions for the machine you want to access s3 from.

### Credentials

IT set up a service account for us to use when accessing the bucket via the cli.  They
added the credentials to the 1password SLV team vault as the S3 service account login.
 

Create a `.aws/credentials` file in your homedir.
Something like this:
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <personal id>
aws_secret_access_key = <personal key>
          
[slv_s3_service_account]
aws_access_key_id = <slv s3 id>
aws_secret_access_key = <slv s3 key>
```

### CLI example

```
aws s3 ls s3://slv-performance-results/ --profile slv_s3_service_account
```

The --profile tells it which set of credentials to use.

There is also a cp, mv, rm...

## Automation use
When we start working on automation to use this, we will need to ensure we have credentials
 on the testrunner, and then copy them to the host that will be accessing the bucket.  We will
 also need to install the cli on the testrunner and the host.  There are libraries for various
 programing languages, but since we will probably use a bolt task to trigger the access, just
 shelling to the aws cli is probably
 easiest.  This [AwsCli module](https://forge.puppet.com/jdowning/awscli) looks promising
 for installing the cli.
